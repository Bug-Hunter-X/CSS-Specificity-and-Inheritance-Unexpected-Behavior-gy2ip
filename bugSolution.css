The solution avoids the use of `inherit` and explicitly sets the color to the desired value:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green;
}
```

By explicitly setting the `color` for `div p` to `green`, the specificity issue is resolved, and the expected style is applied.
