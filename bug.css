The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is overridden by the more specific rule below */
}

div p {
  color: inherit; /* This will inherit the color from the parent, which is blue */
}
```

The issue lies in the inheritance of the `color` property. While `div p` sets `color` to `inherit`, it inherits the `color` from its direct parent (the `div`), not from the more specific rule that sets color to `green`. This might lead to unexpected results if the expectation is for the text in the paragraph to be green.
